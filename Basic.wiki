    *   Metaclasses are used to implement Python class objects. They are the type of types. So type(type) is type.
    *   A metaclass is the class of a class. A class is an instance of a metaclass
    *   *type* is the built-in metaclass Python uses
    {{{
    type is a metaclass in python to create all classes, like int to create integer objects, str to create string object.
    type(name of the lcass,
         tuple of the parent class
         dictionary containing attributes names and values)
    
    class MyShinyClass(object):
        pass
    <==>
    MyShinyClass = type('MyShinyClass', (),{})
    
    class FooChild(Foo):
        pass
    <==>
    FooChild = type('FooChild', (Foo,), {})
