=== USB Spec ===
*   USB Speed       ==>   Hubs isolate high-speed signaling from full-/low-speed
    *   high-speed signaling at 480 Mb/s
    *   full-speed signaling at 12.0 Mb/s
    *   low-speed signaling at 1.5 Mb/s.
signaling environments 
*   USB Frames and Microframes
    *   USB establishes a 1 millisecond time base called a frame on a full-/low-speed bus and a 125¦Ìs time base called a microframe on a high-speed bus. 
    *   A (micro)frame can contain several transactions.  
*   USB Transfer types
    *   Control Transfers:  Bursty, non-periodic, host software-initiated request/response communication, typically used for command/status operations.
    *   Isochronous Transfers:  Periodic, continuous communication between host and device, typically used for time-relevant information. 
    *   Interrupt Transfers:  Low-frequency, bounded-latency communication.
    *   Bulk Transfers:  Non-periodic, large-packet bursty communication, typically used for data that can use any available bandwidth and can also be delayed until bandwidth is available.
*   USB Data Format
    *   Sync Field: All packets begin with a synchronization (SYNC) field, A SYNC from an initial transmitter is defined to be eight bits in length for full/low-speed and 32 bits
for high-speed
    *   Packet Field Formats
        *   Field formats for the token, data, and handshake packets  
        *   PID(Packet Identifier Field): follows SYNC field, consists of four-bit packet type field followed by a four-bit check field

            *  Handshake packets are used to report the status of a data transaction and can return values indicating successful reception of data, command acceptance or rejection, flow control, and halt conditions 
            *  Only transaction types that support flow control can return handshakes. There are four types of handshake packets and one special handshake packet:
                *  ACK:  ACK can be returned by the host for IN transactions and by a function for OUT, SETUP, or PING transactions.
                *  NAK: The host can never issue NAK.
                *  STALL:  The host is not permitted to return a STALL under any condition.
                *  NYET: high-speed

        *   Interrupt Transactions:
